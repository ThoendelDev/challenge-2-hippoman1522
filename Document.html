    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>My css rules are controlling only basic looks, such as padding, and font size. My jquery mobile assets are controlling user interface such as the nav bar at the top of the pages, and the email at the bottom. They are also used for the back buttons on my imbedded pages in the Class.html. They both work together to form a user friendly look, and an easy navigation system.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>User Testing</h1>
    <p> User 1.) What interested him most was the vibrant header color. He went to the school information first and then to the classes. With the embeded pages he had to refresh the page for the links to actually work. after he refreshed they seemed to work fine. He gave a suggustion on my css and to add more padding along the sides. This gave the application a better look for the second user.</p>
    <br>
    <p>User 2.) This user took interest in the nav bar at the top of the screens with the header. They took the opposite route of the first tester and they went to classes first. They didn't have a problem with refreshing the page because i fixed it with a tip from the first user. They suggested that i make the theme a little less colorful which i took in account for my final deliverables.</p>
